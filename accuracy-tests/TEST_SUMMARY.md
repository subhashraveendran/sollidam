## 🧪 Test Coverage

### 1. Round-trip Accuracy Tests (8 tests)
- **Purpose**: Verify encode → decode cycle accuracy
- **Locations**: Chennai, Madurai, Coimbatore, Kanyakumari, Vellore
- **Accuracy**: Within 3 meters (0.00003 degrees)
- **Features**: Tests with and without floor numbers

### 2. Grid Accuracy Tests (2 tests)
- **Purpose**: Verify grid coordinate system
- **Tests**: Latitude/longitude ↔ grid conversion
- **Accuracy**: 100% (no data loss allowed)

### 3. Word Encoding/Decoding Tests (5 tests)
- **Purpose**: Verify word-based encoding system
- **Tests**: Grid ID ↔ word indices conversion
- **Accuracy**: 100% (perfect round-trip)

### 4. Boundary Condition Tests (8 tests)
- **Purpose**: Validate Tamil Nadu boundary detection
- **Tests**: Corner points and out-of-bounds locations
- **Accuracy**: 100% (correct boundary validation)

### 5. Floor Number Tests (6 tests)
- **Purpose**: Test altitude to floor conversion
- **Tests**: Various altitude levels (0m to 300m)
- **Accuracy**: Exact mapping

### 6. Word List Validation (1 test)
- **Purpose**: Verify 3000-word list integrity
- **Tests**: Random word retrieval and validation
- **Accuracy**: 100% (perfect word list)
